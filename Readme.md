## Build
First, get the latest build of Maven at their [website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi);

Then you can build this project via `mvn install`.

Note that as backend used sealed class and switch pattern maching, you may have to update your JDK version to 17+.

And if you fully use maven, you may have to modify the 'release' tag in pom.xml or you have to install JDK 21.

## Notes
We do not support return an array from a method now.
